# :wave: Hi, I'm Marco. 

I'm a **Mechatronics and Biomedical Engineering** student at McMaster University. I currently work for **LocalStudent** automating parts of their daily operations. I used to be part of **Brampton Robotics** as a programmer for the team [1104A](https://github.com/Discobots-1104A).

Programming websites is cool and all, but it's pretty freaking awesome that I can tell a robot how to do things and how not to kill people.

That's about it, honestly. Hope I see you again sometime.
